# Changelog

## [0.10.0] - 2024-12-21

  - Preserves existing page handling and checkbox formatting

## [0.9.2] - 2024-12-21

### Changed

- Modified add_todo tool to use YYYY-MM-DD format for page UIDs:
  - Uses ISO date format (e.g., "2024-12-21") as the parent UID
  - Maintains human-readable date format for page title
  - Simplifies block creation by using date UID directly

## [0.9.1] - 2024-12-21

### Changed

- Improved date formatting for daily pages:
  - Added helper functions for proper ordinal date formatting
  - Updated date format to match Roam's style (e.g., "December 21st, 2024")
  - Applied to both add_todo and create_block tools
  - Ensures consistent date page references

## [0.9.0] - 2024-12-21

### Added

- New `add_todo` tool for adding todo items:

  - Adds todos as top-level blocks in last position

## [0.8.0] - 2024-12-21

### Added

- Enhanced `create_page` tool with nested markdown support:
  - Automatically detects if content is nested markdown (starts with bullet points)
  - Uses import_nested_markdown functionality for nested content
  - Maintains simple block creation for non-nested content
  - Preserves existing page handling behavior

## [0.7.0] - 2024-12-21

### Added

- Enhanced `create_block` tool with page title support:
  - Added optional `title` parameter as an alternative to `page_uid`
  - Automatically finds or creates page by title when specified
  - Maintains backward compatibility with `page_uid` parameter
  - Preserves default behavior of using today's date when neither specified

All notable changes to the Roam Research MCP server will be documented in this file.

    - Generates using alphanumeric plus special chars (-, \_)
    - Enables direct block referencing during creation
    - Allows efficient parent-child relationship management
