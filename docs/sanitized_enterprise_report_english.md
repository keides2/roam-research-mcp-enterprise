# Enterprise Roam Research MCP Integration - Technical Findings Report

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Integrate 2b3pro/roam-research-mcp with Claude Desktop in enterprise network environment
**Timeline**: August 7, 2025
**Result**: Partial success (MCP integration successful, API connection limited due to restrictions)

## Successful Implementations

### 1. Complete Removal of HTTP/SSE Features ✅

**Problem**: Corporate firewall restrictions on ports 8088/8087
**Solution**: Conversion to stdio-only version

#### Removed Code
```typescript
// Removed from src/server/roam-server.ts
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js';
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';
import { createServer, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from 'node:http';
import { findAvailablePort } from '../utils/net.js';
import { CORS_ORIGIN } from '../config/environment.js';

// HTTP-related sections in async run() method (~40 lines) removed
```

#### Removed Files
- `src/utils/net.ts` (port checking functionality)

#### Environment Variables Cleanup
```typescript
// src/config/environment.ts
// Removed: HTTP_STREAM_PORT, SSE_PORT, CORS_ORIGIN
export { API_TOKEN, GRAPH_NAME }; // Minimal required only
```

### 2. Successful Fork Strategy ✅

**Repository**: `username/roam-research-mcp-enterprise`
**Description**: "Enterprise-focused MCP Server for Roam Research (stdio-only, firewall-safe)"

#### Fork Value
- Enterprise environment specialized features
- Clear distinction from original
- Independent development and maintenance

### 3. Successful Claude Desktop Integration ✅

**Configuration File**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roam-research-enterprise": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "C:/Users/USERNAME/mcp-servers/roam-research-mcp-enterprise/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ROAM_API_TOKEN": "your-actual-roam-token",
        "ROAM_GRAPH_NAME": "your-actual-graph-name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: MCP connection successful, tool recognition completed

## Unresolved Issues

### Roam API Connection Limitations ❌

**Error**: `MCP error -32603: Roam API error: fetch failed`

#### Root Cause Analysis

1. **DNS Resolution Failure**
   ```bash
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName roamresearch.com -Port 443
   # WARNING: Name resolution of roamresearch.com failed
   
   nslookup roamresearch.com  
   # DNS request timed out
   ```

2. **Proxy Connection Works**
   ```bash
   curl -x http://corporate-proxy.company.com:3128 https://roamresearch.com
   # ✅ HTML retrieval successful
   ```

3. **Node.js Roam API SDK Proxy Non-compliance**
   - Environment variable settings insufficient
   - SDK internal HTTP connections don't recognize proxy settings

#### Attempted Solutions (All Failed)

##### Method 1: Proxy Environment Variables
```json
"env": {
  "HTTP_PROXY": "http://corporate-proxy.company.com:3128",
  "HTTPS_PROXY": "http://corporate-proxy.company.com:3128",
  "NO_PROXY": "localhost,127.0.0.1,.company.com",
  "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0"
}
```

##### Method 2: Local Proxy
```json
"env": {
  "HTTP_PROXY": "http://127.0.0.1:17200",
  "HTTPS_PROXY": "http://127.0.0.1:17200"
}
```

##### Method 3: Code-level Proxy Support
```typescript
// Added dependencies
npm install http-proxy-agent https-proxy-agent node-fetch@2

// globalAgent setup in constructor
const { HttpProxyAgent } = require('http-proxy-agent');
const { HttpsProxyAgent } = require('https-proxy-agent');
require('http').globalAgent = new HttpProxyAgent(httpProxy);
require('https').globalAgent = new HttpsProxyAgent(httpsProxy);
```

## Technical Insights

### 1. Layered Understanding of Enterprise Network Restrictions

```
Layer 1: Firewall → Port restrictions ✅ Resolved
Layer 2: DNS restrictions → External domain resolution blocked ❌ Unresolved
Layer 3: API communication restrictions → Enterprise policy level ❌ Unresolved
```

### 2. MCP vs Roam API Separation

**Key Discovery**: MCP connection and Roam API connection are separate issues

- ✅ **MCP Connection**: Fully functional via stdio
- ❌ **Roam API Connection**: Failed due to enterprise network restrictions

**Proof**: 
```javascript
// Network-free tools work normally
roam_markdown_cheatsheet → ✅ Success
roam_fetch_page_by_title → ❌ fetch failed
```

### 3. Complexity of Proxy Support

Node.js proxy support requires 3-layer approach:
1. **HTTP/HTTPS connections**: `http-proxy-agent`, `https-proxy-agent`
2. **DNS resolution**: Custom DNS resolver
3. **SDK internal processing**: Library-specific implementation

### 4. Comparative Analysis with Success Cases: FutureVuls・Coverity Connect

#### Technical Rationale for Success Factors

**FutureVuls・Coverity Connect MCP Server**: Works without issues

##### 1. Superiority of Pure REST API Communication
```http
# Typical FutureVuls/Coverity API call
GET /api/v1/vulnerabilities HTTP/1.1
Host: api.futurevuls.com
Authorization: Bearer [token]
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Enterprise Network Compatibility:**
- ✅ **Standard port 443 usage**: Reliable firewall traversal
- ✅ **Single request-response pattern**: Easy proxy server processing  
- ✅ **JSON over HTTP**: Easy analysis and monitoring by enterprise security tools
- ✅ **Simple Bearer authentication**: No complex authentication flows required

##### 2. Complete Compatibility with Proxy Servers
```bash
# Enterprise proxy communication example
curl -x http://corporate-proxy.company.com:3128 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
     https://api.futurevuls.com/vulnerabilities
# → Works without issues
```

#### Communication Architecture Comparison

| Item | FutureVuls/Coverity | Roam Research |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| **API Design** | Simple REST API | REST API + Complex SDK |
| **Communication Layers** | 1 layer (Direct API) | 3 layers (Claude↔MCP↔Roam) |
| **Authentication** | Bearer Token | Custom Token + Graph ID |
| **Proxy Support** | Standard compliant | SDK internal non-compliant |
| **DNS Dependency** | Standard | Conflicts with enterprise filtering |

#### Enterprise Environment Processing Flow

**✅ Success Pattern (FutureVuls/Coverity):**
```
Claude Desktop → MCP Server → [Corporate Proxy] → External API
     ↑              ↑              ↑           ↑
   stdio comm    Simple HTTP    Standard proc   REST response
```

**❌ Failure Pattern (Roam Research):**
```
Claude Desktop → MCP Server → [DNS restriction] ❌ → Roam API
     ↑              ↑              ↑           ↑
   stdio comm✅   Complex SDK    Resolution fail  Unreachable
```

## Future Solutions

### Hybrid Strategy

## Conclusion

This project successfully identified technical barriers in enterprise environment MCP integration and achieved partial resolution. The creation of a `stdio-only` version through HTTP/SSE removal was completely successful and resolved corporate firewall issues.

However, Roam API connection limitations were found to be enterprise network policy-level issues, revealing limits to purely technical solutions.

**Key Discovery**: The reason FutureVuls and Coverity Connect MCP Servers work without issues in enterprise environments is due to their **pure REST API design** and **standard compatibility with corporate proxies**. This is not coincidental, but a natural result of inherent compatibility with enterprise network architecture.

These insights provide valuable experience applicable to other projects performing API integration in similar enterprise environments. Particularly, this demonstrates the importance of **enterprise environment considerations during API design phases**.
